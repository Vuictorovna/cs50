        <h5>More and more businesses, as well as individuals, are choosing to communicate either professionally
        or socially using technology rather than being face to face.
        <br>Discuss advantages and disadvantages of using technology for communicating.
        </h5>

        <div class="content">

            <p>In the modern world, technology is permeating every aspect of human life.
            Thus, the mode of interaction has changed enormously over the past 20 years.
            Nowadays people prefer to use different software applications while communicating instead of having a conversation in person.
            This essay will explain the positive and negative aspects of online communication.</p>
            <p>One of the most important advantages of using technology is that it helps to remove geographical barriers for business.
            In other words, an entrepreneur can contact his overseas business partners instantly using email or Skype.
            This can be beneficial for the expansion of his business as he can interact with people from all over the world.
            Moreover, this way of communication helps to reduce a lot of overheads like ticket and hotel expenses.</p>
            <p>Secondly, many people have no time to travel. However, they still can be connected with any person they want to in just a click.
            It bridges the gap between friends who live far away from each other and do not have the opportunity to meet regularly.
            So, they can stay in touch using any of the social media sites.</p>
            <p>On the flip side, the overuse of communication technologies has its own drawbacks.
            To begin with, people lose the personal connection when they refrain from face to face conversation.
            This can make them feel lonely and depressed as they are devoid of social life and it can have a detrimental effect on their mental health.
            Another major disadvantage of mobile applications is a security issue.
            Since the entire communication is online, it is possible that scammers might break into a dialog and steal important passwords or information.</p>
            <p>To sum up, modern technology has significantly changed the way people communicate.
            Various mobile applications are becoming increasingly popular, which helps not only businessmen to negotiate with their overseas investors,
            but also friends to keep in touch with each other.
            However, online communication has its drawbacks, such as depression in humans who stop meeting friends in the real world,
            as well as scammers who can steal valuable information from online dialogue.</p>
