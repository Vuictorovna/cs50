            <p>The table illustrates the consumption of five different types of fast foods in the past (2005), present and in the future (2025)
            in Melbourne.</p>
            <p>Overall, what stands out from the table is that the most popular fast food is hamburgers followed by fried chicken.
            The least consumed fast food items are fried rice and noodles.
            Another interesting point is that salads are estimated to be consumed in high amounts in future.</p>
            <p>Looking at the details, the number of hamburgers eaten in 2005 was 40 with a slight decrease in the present and it will increase
            noticeably to 51 by 2025.
            The second popular item is fried chicken with a consumption of 35 units in 2005 and its popularity will grow by 10 units in 2025.
            Fried rice and noodles are the least common dishes and it is prognosticated that there would not be much difference in their consumption.</p>
            <p>By contrast, salads were not the favorite food in the past with just about 5 units in 2005.
            However, their consumption has tripled in the present day.
            It is predicted that more people would eat this dish by 2025 and this figure would rise by 8 times compared to the past to 41 units.</p>
