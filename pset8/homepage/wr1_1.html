            <p>The provided line graph illustrates information about the percentage of people who use the tube station in London,
            over a one-day period between 6:00 am and 10:00 pm.</p>
            <p>Overall, what stands out from the graph is that there are two peak times of the number of passengers
            at the underground station over the period in question.</p>
            <p>Looking at the details, the highest number of people use the station in the morning.
            A rapid growth can be observed between 6:00 am and 8:00 am when around 400 people are located at the station at around 7:30 am.
            This quantity then quickly drops to below 200 at 10:00 am.
            Again this figure rises between 11:00 am and 3:00 pm when around 300 people use the underground station with some fluctuations. </p>
            <p>By contrast, in the afternoon, this index decline, with less than 100 people are detected at the station at 4:00 pm.
            At 6:00 pm data reaches at 380.
            After 7:00 pm the total number of passengers declines significantly and fluctuates for the last two hours from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm.</p>
